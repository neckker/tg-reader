![Preview](assets/preview.png)

tg-reader is a lightweight, browser-based Telegram chat viewer designed to load and display large chat histories directly from the `result.json` export file (no HTML exports required). It offers a clean, dark-themed interface and supports pagination, date separators, media playback, reactions, and inline replies.

## Features

- **Load Local JSON**  
  Simply click “Load History” and select your `result.json` export file. No server or external dependencies required.

- **Dark Theme & Responsive Layout**  
  Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, dark-themed UI. Message containers are limited to a comfortable max-width (`max-w-7xl`) and automatically adapt to various screen sizes.

- **Pagination**  
  Chat histories with thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of messages are split into pages of 200 messages each. Navigate through pages with “Previous Page” / “Next Page” buttons. When moving forward, the view scrolls to the top; when moving backward, your scroll position is preserved for continuous reading.

- **Date Separators**  
  Messages are grouped by date. Whenever the date changes, a separator line appears:
